  '### fpvConstructionHelper\n\n\
**Project Overview:**\n\
The fpvConstructionHelper is a tool I developed out of my passion for **FPV drone flying**.\n\
While building my own drone, I frequently had to perform the same calculations manually. To simplify the process,\n\
I created and published this lightweight application to automate these calculations.\n\
Additionally, I implemented a feature that generates **drone rate graphs** and automatically converts them between different control systems.\n\n\
**Key Features:**\n\
- Automates essential **FPV drone build calculations**, saving time during assembly and tuning.\n\
- Provides **graphical visualization** of drone rates for better tuning and adjustments.\n\
- Supports **automatic conversion** between different rate systems used in FPV drone controllers.\n\
- Open-source and available for the FPV community to use and contribute to.\n\n\
The project is available on GitHub: **[fpvConstructionHelper](https://piotr-placzek-software.github.io/fpv-construction-helper/)**.';
