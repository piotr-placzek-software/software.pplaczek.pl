  '### EKM Smart – Config Tool\n\n\
**Project Overview:**\n\
EKM Smart – Config Tool is a web-based application installed on an embedded device designed for industrial communication protocol conversion.\n\
The EKM Smart device serves as a gateway that supports **Modbus TCP, Modbus RTU, and IEC 103** protocols.\n\
The tool provides engineers and technicians with an intuitive interface for configuring communication port parameters,\n\
monitoring device performance, and mapping data between protocols.\n\n\
**My Role:**\n\
As a developer on this project, I worked on both the backend and frontend to deliver a fully functional configuration tool.\n\
This was my **first web application project**, marking my transition from embedded systems and desktop development\n\
to web technologies.\n\n\
**Key Experience & Achievements:**\n\
- Developed the **backend using NestJS** to handle device communication and configuration management.\n\
- Designed and implemented the **frontend in Vue.js** for a user-friendly configuration interface.\n\
- Used **SQLite** as the lightweight database solution for storing device settings.\n\
- Built a real-time monitoring feature to display live status updates of the device.\n\
- Implemented **protocol mapping functionalities**, allowing users to define data conversions between Modbus and IEC 103.\n\
- Deployed the application directly on the **embedded device**, ensuring performance and reliability in industrial environments.\n\n\
This project provided me with foundational experience in **full-stack web development**,\n\
particularly in building embedded web applications for industrial automation.';
