  "### About Me\n\n\
I'm a **fullstack web developer** with a strong passion for backend development. While I work on frontend projects as well, I consider it a complementary skill rather than my main focus.\n\n\
I specialize in **NestJS, Express.js, Fastify, TypeORM, PrismaORM, RabbitMQ, Git, and Angular**. I also have a basic understanding of **React.js**, though I haven't worked with it professionally. My development workflow is Linux-based, and I primarily use **terminal tools**, with **Neovim** as my go-to IDE.\n\n\
#### **Career Path**\n\
I began my programming career in **2014** as a **C++ desktop software developer**, focusing on **engineering applications for the energy sector**. During this time, I also gained experience with **embedded systems**.\n\n\
Since **2021**, I have transitioned into **web development**, which has become my primary area of expertise. In **2024**, I took the next step by launching my own **freelance business**.\n\n\
#### **Personal Interests**\n\
Beyond coding, I'm passionate about **sport archery, sailing, smart home automation, 3D printing, board games, and FPV drone flying**. I also enjoy painting **miniatures for board and tabletop wargames**.\n\n\
I'm always looking for **new challenges and opportunities** to expand my skills, particularly in **backend architecture, distributed systems, and high-performance applications**.";
