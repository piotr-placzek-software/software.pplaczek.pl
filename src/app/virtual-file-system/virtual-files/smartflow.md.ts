  '### SmartFlow – Waterworks Monitoring System\n\n\
**Project Overview:**\n\
SmartFlow by GetFlow (Future Processing) is a real-time monitoring system for waterworks infrastructure.\n\
It collects data from sensors embedded in the water distribution network across the city.\n\
The system analyzes water flow parameters and detects anomalies such as hidden leakages or faults.\n\
When an issue is identified, its location is visualized on a city map, enabling engineers\n\
to quickly locate and repair the fault, minimizing water losses and improving infrastructure efficiency.\n\n\
**My Role:**\n\
As a backend developer with frontend responsibilities, I contributed to the development and maintenance of the system’s core functionalities.\n\
My work focused on **NestJS, TypeORM, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, and Angular** to ensure reliable data processing and visualization.\n\n\
**Key Experience & Achievements:**\n\
- Developed and optimized backend services for real-time data ingestion and analysis.\n\
- Implemented database structures and queries in **PostgreSQL** to handle large volumes of sensor data.\n\
- Integrated **RabbitMQ** for efficient communication between system components.\n\
- Contributed to the transition from an older **Angular** version to a newer framework for improved UI performance.\n\
- Worked closely with engineers to ensure accurate fault detection and mapping.\n\n\
This role enhanced my expertise in **backend development, real-time data processing, and frontend integration**,\n\
strengthening my ability to build scalable, data-driven applications.';
